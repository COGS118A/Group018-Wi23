    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning algorithm that can accurately classify stars into galaxies, quasars, and stars. The dataset used is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and it contains observations of stars including 17 feature columns and 1 class column. We will preprocess the data by cleaning and extracting useful features before training a machine learning algorithm, specifically the K-nearest neighbors method(KNN), to classify the stars. The primary measure of success will be accuracy in correctly classifying the stars, which can be described as the total number of correct classifications over the total number of observations. We believe that through this project, we can develop a way to classify stars more accurately and more efficiently, thus enhancing our understanding of the universe and even possibly narrowing the range of habitable planets.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler-438b is a rocky planet discovered in 2015 that is located 640 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra, with a mass of 1.46 Earths<sup>[1]</sup>. What makes it special is that Kepler-438b locates right on the habitable zone of its parent star (0.166 AU), making the temperature just right for water to exist in a liquid state<sup>[2]</sup>. This means that if one day humans have to migrate to another planet, Kepler-438b becomes a potential second earth, and this finding can also indicate that life might exist on Kepler-438b. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other than Kepler-438b, scientists have found 11 more small Kepler transiting planets located in the habitable zone, and using techniques such as big data analysis and supervised machine learning, we could possibly find more habitable planets with higher efficiency compared to traditional methods of stellar classification. Bailer-Jones, for instance, pointed out in their paper that “current and future large astronomical surveys will yield multiparameter databases on millions or even billions of objects”<sup>[3]</sup>, which is why it becomes necessary to let computers do the work instead of manually classifying and labeling all the stars. They also discussed how the technique of unsupervised machine learning does not work well, because it produces “natural groupings” instead of groupings based on definitions provided by astrologists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Baqui also acknowledged the challenges presented with large datasets and successfully implemented machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks to train and classify stars<sup>[4]</sup>. With these previous successful examples, we believe that we can also use supervised machine learning algorithms to classify galaxies, quasars, and stars using features such as ascension, declination, or filters of the photometric system<sup>[5]</sup>. Though challenges such as outlier detection and handling sparse datasets commonly exist for the task of stellar classification<sup>[6]</sup>, we will do our best to address these problems."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast universe has always fascinated us, and we have been exploring the stars and galaxies for centuries. What if we could develop a machine learning model that could accurately classify astronomical objects based on their spectral characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a state-of-the-art model that can accurately classify stars, galaxies, and quasars using the SDSS dataset. With 17 feature columns and 1 class column, we have a treasure trove of information waiting to be unlocked. Imagine being able to predict the class of an astronomical object with high accuracy, opening up a new era of space exploration and discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use advanced techniques like deep learning and ensemble models to achieve the highest accuracy possible. With cutting-edge evaluation techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, we can fine-tune our model to perfection. We can measure the accuracy of our model using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix, and we can observe the performance of our model through testing."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we are planning to work with is the 17th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17). This data was collected to perform a stellar classification task and it contains 100000 observations. Each observation contains 17 feature variables that describe various aspects of the observation and 1 class variable that labels the class of the observation as either a galaxy, star, or quasar object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 17 features that each observation has, 5 of these features are used for identification of the observation (obj_id, run_id, rerun_id, field_id, spec_obj_id) and 4 other features are used to describe different aspects about how the data was captured.(cam_col, plate, MJD, fiber_ID). The features used for identification help researchers keep track of each observation, which is an arduous task with 100000 observation. The features used to describe data collection are also critical for researchers to keep track of as they detail the circumstances that led to the recording of each observation. However, for a machine learning classification task, this data is not of utmost importance. The remaining 8 variables are all crucial to classifying the celestial body. These variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- alpha: Right ascension angle at J200 epoch\n",
    "- delta: Declination angle at J200 epoch\n",
    "- u: ultraviolet filter in the photometric system\n",
    "- g: green filter in the photometric system\n",
    "- r: red filter in the photometric system\n",
    "- i: near infrared filter in the photometric system\n",
    "- z: infrared filter in the photometric system\n",
    "- redshift: redshift value based on the increase in wavelength\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these variables hold continuous floating point values, so they will be normalized using z-scores. The class feature that labels the observation is a categorical feature, and this will be one hot encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as cleaning this dataset, the features used for identification and to describe data collection will likely be dropped. The obj_id field may be kept to ensure there is one identification field. This would result in the dataset being cut down to 10 variables in total, with 8 feature variables, 1 identification variable, and 1 class variable. Also, using all 100000 observations may prove to be too much of a computational burden to work with, in which case we would randomly sample a smaller subset of the larger dataset and work with that to build our classifier."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the classification problem of astronomical objects, we propose building a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model using cross-validation to benchmark our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by preprocessing the data, which includes normalizing the feature columns and converting the class column into categorical labels. We will then use cross-validation to split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that the data is well-distributed across both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the KNN model, we will choose the number of neighbors (k) based on the performance on the validation set. We will use a distance metric, such as Euclidean or Manhattan, to calculate the distance between data points. We will train the KNN model using the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. We will use accuracy as the primary metric to evaluate the performance of the KNN model. We will also report the precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance in each class."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is the primary metric we will use to quantify performance. Accuracy is a measure of the proportion of observations that were classified correctly. In the case of a binary classification, it could be represented like this:\n",
    "$$Accuracy = \\frac{True Positives + True Negatives}{Total No. of Observations}$$\n",
    "However, our classifier is working with multiple classes, so calculating accuracy for our classifier would be to alter the equation to:\n",
    "$$Accuracy = \\frac{Total No. of Correct Classifications}{Total No. of Observations}$$\n",
    "For example, if our model is being tested on 100 observations, and 26 were correctly classified as stars, 28 were correctly classified as galaxies, and 36 were correctly classified as quasar objects, the accuracy would be 0.80. Accuracy is a good measure for this task since our main goal is to classify as many observations correctly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score, precision, and recall would also be a useful to help gain a better insight on specific aspects of model performance. These metrics can be calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$precision = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positive + False Positives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$recall = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Negatives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F1 = \\frac{2(precison)(recall)}{precision + recall}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision gives us the proportion of objects that have been correctly classified with respect to all the objects that have been classified in that class. Recall gives us what proportion of a certain class has been correctly classified. F1 score gives us a harmonic mean of precision and recall. Because this is a multi class classifier, this metrics can be measured for each class. For example, out of a 100 objects labelled as galaxies by our classifier, if 93 are actually galaxies, precision is 0.93. Similarly, for 100 actual galaxies, if 88 are correctly classified as galaxies, recall is 0.88. The F1 score would then be 0.90."
